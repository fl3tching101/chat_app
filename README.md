Peer-to-peer chat app using Godot game engine as a simple demo of peer-to-peer multiplayer. Currently supports up to 10 chatters, but this can be changed to however many you desire.

# Resources
[Ian's Tech Blog](https://blog.iancolwell.ca/godot-multiplayer-networking-cheatsheet) has a good cheatsheet for quickly referencing.

[Godot's official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html) is of course also a great resource!
